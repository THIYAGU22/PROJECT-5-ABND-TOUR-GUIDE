# PROJECT-5-ABND-TOUR-GUIDE
I'VE DESCRIBED MY PLACE IN MY APP
The goal is to create a tour guide app which presents relevant information to a user whoâ€™s visiting your city. 
The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.
It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know.

## CONCEPTS COVERED:

- Planning the app design and navigation before coding.

- Selecting proper data structures to store lists of information.

- Building layouts to display those lists of data.

- Navigating between those lists using intents and multiple Activities or a ViewPager.

- Creating your own custom classes.

- Properly handling images or audio
